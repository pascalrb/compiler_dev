# Compiler Development 
Repo for compiler development practice and analysis. Code generation and code optimization.

forked from ncstate_ece566_spring2023 by Prof. [James Tuck](https://ece.ncsu.edu/people/jtuck/)


#           Added Projects:

## Matrix Operations Compiler (p1)
Matrix operations: 
matrix multiplication, division, addition, substraction, transpose, inversion, reduce, determinant

Front-end parser/grammar: Bison & Flex
Back-end code generation: LLVM infrastructure


## Optimization Passes (p2)
Optimizations:
- Common-Subexpression Elimination (CSE)
- Load/Store redundancy check simplification 
- Dead Code Elimination (DCE)


## Function Inlining Optimization Heuristics Analysis (p3)
Use LLVM IR to perform function inlining optimization based on various heuristics.
